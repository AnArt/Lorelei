# Lorelei Project

This project is our attempt to create something like Artificial Intelligence.
The Lorelei kernel is written in C++ and can be linked into application as a dynamic library (libLorelei.so).
We are using QtCreator as main IDE in developing Lora, but it can be easely ported to other IDEs.
